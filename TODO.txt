Front-end refactor

Reduce the data being retrieved by the front end

# 1. The Post list has a nested field which is the comment table, 
    Would be better if just remove it and just use it in PostView component which is 
    retrieving a single post but it include its comments

# 2. Add Registration Field where the user is able to update his/her profile
